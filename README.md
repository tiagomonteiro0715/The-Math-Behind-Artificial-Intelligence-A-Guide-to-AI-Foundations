Here you can find the code I use in my freecodecamp news articles. 

Here is one I have in another repository:

[Signal Processing and Systems in Programming – Guide for Beginners](https://github.com/tiagomonteiro0715/Signal-Processing-and-Systems-in-Programming-Guide-for-Beginners)

And here is the github repository to the python and latex code of the book: The-Math-Behind-Artificial-Intelligence-A-Guide-to-AI-Foundations

Additionally, the images I create for my articles can also be found there. 

Feel free to use them!

[Here](https://ray.so/) is the site I use to create the code images.
